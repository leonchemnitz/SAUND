## Installation

SAUND is compatible with all Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) that support the VST3 standard (i.e. most of them e.g. [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/de/live/), [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Cubase](https://www.steinberg.net/de/cubase/), [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/de/pro-tools)).
You can choose to compile SAUND yourself but this requires more in-depth knowledge about C++ and the JUCE framework.
Alternatively, you can download a pre-compiled version here.

Once you have your .vst file please consult the documentation of your specific DAW on how to install a VST3 plugin
(the process differs a bit for every DAW but is usually pretty straightforward).
